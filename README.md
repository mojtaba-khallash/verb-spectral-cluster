===================
      10 January 2013

This is the README for the *"VerbSpectralCluster" package* that is used for adding 
verb spectral cluster id to dependency parsing. This package has been developed 
by [Mojtaba Khallash] (mailto: mkhallash@gmail.com) from _Iran University of Science and 
Technology (IUST)_.

The home page for the project is:
  http://nlp.iust.ac.ir
	
If you want to use this software for research, please refer to this web address 
in your papers.

The package can be used freely for non-commercial research and educational 
purposes. It comes with no warranty, but we welcome all comments, bug reports, 
and suggestions for improvements.

1. Compiling
----------------

Requirements:
* Version 1.7 or later of the [Java 2 SDK] (http://java.sun.com)
You must add java binary file to system path.<br/> In linux, your
can open `~/.bashrc` file and append this line:
`PATH=$PATH:/<address-of-bin-folder-of-JRE>`

To compile the code, first decompress the package:

in linux:
> tar -xvzf VerbSpectralCluster.tgz<br/>
> cd VerbSpectralCluster<br/>
> sh compile.sh

in windows:
> decompress the VerbSpectralCluster.zip<br/>
> compile.bat

You can open the all projects in NetBeans 7.1 (or maybe later) too
in both platforms.

2. Example of Usage
---------------------

Goal of this package is adding id of semantic cluster to all verbs of 
dependency treebank. We use results of semantic classification of verbs in 
Persian language based on Levinâ€™s idea [1].

3. Running the package
-------------------------

This package run in two mode: 

* gui [Default mode]<br/>
Simply double click on jar file or run the following command:

> java -jar VerbSpectralCluster.jar

* command-line<br/>
In order to running package in command-line mode must be set -v flag (visible) 
to 0:

> java -jar VerbSpectralCluster.jar -v 0 -i input-file -o output-file

<table>
<tr><td>-i &lt;Input CoNLL file&gt;</td><td>intput CoNLL file that you want to add semantic verb cluster IDs to it <b>FEATS</b> column.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-o &lt;Output CoNLL file&gt;</td><td>name of output CoNLL file.</td></tr>
</table>

For example:

> java -jar VerbSpectralCluster.jar -v 0 -i input.conll -o output.conll
